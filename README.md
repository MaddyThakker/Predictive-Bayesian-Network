# Predictive-Bayesian-Network
Predictive model using Bayesian networks in R

Aim is to develop a predictive model using Bayesian networks for calculating probability of heart disease (presence or absence) using the values of attributes given. 

Dataset used - heart disease data from UCI machine learning database
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease 

10 attributes chosen randomly to build and learn bayesian network using those 10 attributes. Some attributes are continuous and some discrete.
